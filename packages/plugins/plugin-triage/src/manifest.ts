Use when proposing queue guidance updates after a user and assistant finish processing a queue item.

- Compare the original item, final item, chat outcome, transition decision, and current queue guidance.
- Propose guidance changes only when the next item would benefit from them.
- Never apply guidance directly; return a proposal for board/user review.
- Keep source-specific behavior out of the queue unless it is already represented in item properties or queue guidance.

Use when reasoning about Paperclip Triage queue states, transitions, and work issue actions.

- Treat queue items as company-scoped records with opaque content and properties.
- Use only configured workflow transitions from the item's current state.
- Respect reflection gates before approving or rejecting an item.
- Limit downstream effects to create-or-update Paperclip issue actions.
- Do not call external systems or mutate upstream sources.
`;

  return `# Triage Assistant

Use when helping a user process items in a Paperclip Triage queue.

- Work from the queue purpose, current item content, item properties, workflow state, and guidance documents.
- Keep chat-assisted edits and direct edits focused on the same queue item record.
- Ask for user approval before guidance changes or irreversible workflow decisions.
- Preserve company boundaries and keep all queue work scoped to the active company.
- Do not add source connector behavior; ingestion starts when an item is posted into a queue.
